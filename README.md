Git conflict resolution
=======================

  Resolving conflicts in Git looks difficult and scary at first, but it's absolutely
  essential to working in a team. In this repo, you'll find demos and exercises for
  becoming more comfortable with conflict resolution.

Usage
-----

  Run the `create-playground.sh` shell script to create a playground.
  Go to the directory `/tmp/playground/exercises/` for the exercises.


Some general tips
-----------------

  “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,” as the saying goes. Here are
  some tips that can help prevent the difficulty of resolving conflicts.

  1. **Keep your branches small:** small branches touch fewer files and are live
     for a shorter period of time. This reduces the chances that someone else will
     introduce changes that will conflict with yours.

  2. **Rebase often:** Regularly rebase against the master branch (or the branch
     you forked off of). It's easier and faster to fix a few small conflicts than
     to fix one large conflict.

  3. **Talk to your teammates:** It's easier to manage conflicts if you know that
     large changes are coming than if they appear completely unexpected.
